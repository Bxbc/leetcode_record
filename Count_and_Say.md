###Count and Say Discription

####The Basics:
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

>
>* 1:  1
>* 2: 11
>* 3: 21
>* 4: 1211
>* 5: 111221

```
1
```
 is read off as "one 1" or 11.  
```
11
```
 is rad off as "two is " or 21.  
```
21
```
 is read off as "one 2", then "one 1" or 1211.  

Given an integer 
```
n
```
where \\(1 \leq n \leq 30\\), generate the $n^{th}$ term of the count-and-say sequence.  
**Note**: Each term of the sequence of intgers will be represented as a string.  

**Example 1**:  

	Input: 1  
	Output: "1"

**Example 2**  

	Input: 4
	Output: "1211"
